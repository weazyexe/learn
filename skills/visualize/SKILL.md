description: "Add a correct, minimal visual to a lesson — a diagram or geometric picture — that renders inline in the Obsidian log. Use when an idea is genuinely clearer as a picture: a dependency graph, system/flow, sequence, state machine, tree, comparison, or a spatial/geometric thing (coordinate geometry, number line, vectors, a plot, a physical layout). Outsources authoring+rendering to a maker subagent that verifies the image by looking at it, then you embed the returned file."

# Visualize

A picture earns its place only when it shows something words can't — shape, structure, direction, relationship, geometry. This skill produces ONE such picture, guarantees it is **correct** (the maker renders it and looks at it before returning), and drops it into the lesson so it renders inline in the Obsidian session log.

You are the **creative director**. You decide the exact idea and distill it to its fewest carrying elements. A **maker subagent** does the authoring, rendering, visual verification, and saving, then returns a filename. You embed that filename in your reply.

## When to visualize (and when not to)

This teaching system builds a **dependency graph in the learner's head** — axioms at the root, derived facts hanging off them. A visual is powerful exactly when it makes that structure (or a geometry) visible. Reach for one when:

- The idea is a **structure or relationship**: dependencies, a system with parts and arrows, a flow/pipeline, a sequence of exchanges, a state machine, a tree/hierarchy, a comparison, a containment (what's inside vs outside).
- The idea is **spatial or geometric**: coordinate geometry, a number line, vectors, a function's shape, a physical arrangement.

Do NOT visualize when prose or a single equation already carries it. A decorative diagram that just restates the sentence next to it adds noise and a chance to be wrong. When in doubt, don't — a missing visual is cheaper than a false one.

## Choose the maker

Two makers, installed as subagents (see this repo's `install.sh`):

- **`mermaid-maker`** — structural/relational visuals: dependency graphs, flowcharts, sequence/state/ER/class diagrams, trees, mindmaps, timelines. This is the default and fits the dependency-graph pedagogy directly.
- **`svg-maker`** — spatial/geometric visuals Mermaid can't lay out: exact coordinates, geometry figures, number lines, vectors, plots, custom shapes.

Rule of thumb: if it's *nodes-and-edges / relationships*, use mermaid-maker. If it's *positions-and-shapes / geometry*, use svg-maker.

## Brief the maker well: one idea, fewest elements

The most common failure is **cramming** — every extra label makes the picture harder to read AND harder to lay out correctly. Before briefing, prune to the fewest elements that carry the idea, and for each ask: *"if I delete this, is the idea still clear?"* If yes, delete it.

Give the maker the concept AND the concrete elements you want — not a vague topic, and not a long checklist.

- BAD: "make a diagram about how TCP works"
- GOOD: "graph TD: a node 'packet' at the top; arrows down to 'ordering' and 'retransmit on loss'; both arrows down into 'reliable stream'. No title. Show that reliability is built FROM packets, not alongside them."

Keep the idea intact but trust the maker to compose; if your brief lists more than ~5–7 elements, cut it first.

## Invoke

Spawn the maker as a subagent with your harness's mechanism:

- **Claude Code**: the Agent/Task tool with `subagent_type: mermaid-maker` (or `svg-maker`).
- **OpenCode**: the `task` tool with the `mermaid-maker` / `svg-maker` agent.
- **Codex**: spawn the `mermaid-maker` / `svg-maker` custom agent.

The maker sees none of this conversation, so the task must be self-contained. Always end it with these three lines (absolute paths):

```
<your minimal, concrete brief>

scripts: <absolute path of this skill's scripts/ folder>
viz_dir: <absolute path of the viz folder>
```

- **scripts**: the `scripts/` folder next to this SKILL.md (resolve it from the path you loaded this skill from). It holds `render_mermaid.sh`, `render_svg.sh` and `publish.sh`.
- **viz_dir**: the `viz/` folder **next to the session log** (log at `lessons/tcp.md` → `lessons/viz/`). No log → `<cwd>/viz`.

The maker authors the source in a scratch folder, renders it to a PNG with the scripts, **looks at the PNG and iterates until it is correct and clean**, publishes it into `viz_dir` with a unique filename, and returns:

```
RESULT:
filename: viz-<slug>-<timestamp>.png
path: <viz_dir>/viz-<slug>-<timestamp>.png
```

**No subagents available?** Don't visualize. Drop the picture rather than hand-author an unverified one in the main thread.

If it returns `RESULT: NONE`, it couldn't make a correct picture of the brief — simplify or rethink, or decide the visual isn't worth it. Never hand-author or fake a diagram yourself; correctness depends on the maker's render-and-inspect loop.

## Embed it in the lesson

Put the embed directly in your teaching reply, as a standard markdown image with a path **relative to the log file** and an Obsidian display width in the alt text:

```
![<slug>|500](viz/viz-<slug>-<timestamp>.png)
```

Obsidian renders it at width 500. Any other markdown viewer (VS Code, GitHub) renders it too, because the path is relative to the log and the `viz/` folder sits next to it. You copy your lesson prose into the session log verbatim, so the embed lands there and renders inline. Width `|500` is a good default; use larger for dense diagrams. Introduce the visual in a sentence, then let it carry the idea — don't narrate every element back in prose.

## Why this is reliable

- The maker never returns a picture it hasn't **looked at**, so "renders fine but says something false" is caught before it reaches the learner.
- PNG embed means **what the maker verified is pixel-identical to what the learner sees** — no re-render drift.
- Unique filenames mean an embed never silently points at a different, older picture.

> The makers render through this skill's `scripts/` (Mermaid via `mmdc` or `npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`, reusing an installed Chrome; SVG via `rsvg-convert`, fallback ImageMagick). You don't render anything yourself — you only brief the maker and embed the filename it returns.
